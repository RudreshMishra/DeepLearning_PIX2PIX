# DeepLearning_PIX2PIX

This project involved undrstanding different Deep learning models and implementing the PIX2PIX.

(https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/generative/pix2pix.ipynb#scrollTo=DMTm4peo
The used dataset is from http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/archive/sketchdatabase/CUHK/
(http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/archive/sketchdatabase/CUHK/)
The used case application for which we have implemented our project is from sketch to face generation and face to sketch generation


	1. Data

		Data used to train the pix2pix model. its an CUHK Face Sketch database (CUFS) is for research on face sketch synthesis and face sketch 			recognition.refernce :- http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/archive/facesketch.html
